    ///
    /// \brief Send Sends a message.
    /// \param Message The message to send.
    /// \param ReceiptRequired OPTIONAL Indicates that the message should be retransmitted until a receipt is received from the endpoint.  Defaults to FALSE.
    /// \param Tracker OPTIONAL A pointer to a tracker for continuous updates on the sent message's status. Defaults to NULL (e.g. no tracking).
    /// \return Returns TRUE if the message was queued into the TX queue.  Returns FALSE if the TX queue is full.
    /// \details This places a message into the TX queue for sending.  The communicator sends messages from the queue based on highest priority, followed
    /// by earliest.  The calling code can keep track of the message's status using the Tracker parameter.  The Communicator will update the Tracker
    /// pointer as the message's status changes.  Once placed in the queue, the message's status is set to SC::MessageStatus::Queued.

    /// \return A pointer to the received message.  Will return NULL if no messages are available.
    /// \note The calling code shall become responsible for the Message pointer and must clean up the Message's resources.
